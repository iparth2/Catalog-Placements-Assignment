Step 1: Install the nlohmann/json Library
Option 1: Directly Download the Header File

Go to the nlohmann/json GitHub repository.
Download the json.hpp file from the repository. You can usually find it under the "single include file" section.
Option 2: Use a Package Manager

vcpkg:

Install vcpkg following the instructions here.
Run vcpkg install nlohmann-json to install the library.
Conan:

Install Conan following the instructions here.
Create a conanfile.txt with the following content:
csharp
Copy code
[requires]
nlohmann_json/3.11.2

[generators]
cmake
Run conan install . to install the library.
Step 2: Save the C++ Code
Open a text editor and paste the provided C++ code.
Save the file with a .cpp extension, e.g., shamir.cpp.
Step 3: Create the JSON Input File
Open a text editor and paste your JSON input.
Save the file as input.json in the same directory where your shamir.cpp file is located.
Step 4: Compile the C++ Code
Using g++ (GNU Compiler Collection):

Open a terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows).

Navigate to the directory where you saved shamir.cpp and input.json.

If you downloaded json.hpp directly, compile the code using:

sh
Copy code
g++ -o shamir shamir.cpp
If you used a package manager (vcpkg or Conan), you might need to include the library path. For example, with vcpkg, it would be:

sh
Copy code
g++ -o shamir shamir.cpp -I/path/to/vcpkg/installed/x64-windows/include
For Conan:

sh
Copy code
g++ -o shamir shamir.cpp -I/path/to/conan/include
Step 5: Run the Compiled Program
In the terminal, execute the compiled program:
sh
Copy code
./shamir
On Windows, you might need to use:
sh
Copy code
shamir.exe
Summary of Commands
Download the JSON library (if not using a package manager).
Save the C++ code as shamir.cpp.
Create the JSON input file named input.json.
Compile the code:
sh
Copy code
g++ -o shamir shamir.cpp -I/path/to/json/include
Run the program:
sh
Copy code
./shamir
This will read the JSON file, perform the necessary computations, and print the constant term 
ùëê
c. If you encounter any issues, make sure the paths to the JSON library are correctly specified and the files are in the right directory.
